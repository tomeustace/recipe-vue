## Usage 

1. npm run dev
2. http://localhost:8080
3. Fill out form with recipe data

TODO: create custom js bundle when user clicks create button.  Am using Webpack to insert json from form and creating custom bundle but need to pick up from here to tailor bundle and expose it for download or embedding. 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
